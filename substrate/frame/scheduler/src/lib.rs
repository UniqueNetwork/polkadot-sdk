//! # Scheduler Pallet
//!
//! A Pallet for scheduling runtime calls.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This Pallet exposes capabilities for scheduling runtime calls to occur at a specified block
//! number or at a specified period. These scheduled runtime calls may be named or anonymous and may
//! be canceled.
//!
//! __NOTE:__ Instead of using the filter contained in the origin to call `fn schedule`, scheduled
//! runtime calls will be dispatched with the default filter for the origin: namely
//! `frame_system::Config::BaseCallFilter` for all origin types (except root which will get no
//! filter).
//!
//! If a call is scheduled using proxy or whatever mechanism which adds filter, then those filter
//! will not be used when dispatching the schedule runtime call.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! 1. Scheduling a runtime call at a specific block.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/tests.rs", basic_scheduling_works)]
//!
//! 2. Scheduling a preimage hash of a runtime call at a specific block
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/tests.rs", scheduling_with_preimages_works)]

//!
//! ## Pallet API
//!
//! See the [`pallet`] module for more information about the interfaces this pallet exposes,
//! including its configuration trait, dispatchables, storage items, events and errors.
//!
//! ## Warning
//!
//! This Pallet executes all scheduled runtime calls in the [`on_initialize`] hook. Do not execute
//! any runtime calls which should not be considered mandatory.
//!
//! Please be aware that any scheduled runtime calls executed in a future block may __fail__ or may
//! result in __undefined behavior__ since the runtime could have upgraded between the time of
//! scheduling and execution. For example, the runtime upgrade could have:
//!
//! * Modified the implementation of the runtime call (runtime specification upgrade).
//!     * Could lead to undefined behavior.
//! * Removed or changed the ordering/index of the runtime call.
//!     * Could fail due to the runtime call index not being part of the `Call`.
//!     * Could lead to undefined behavior, such as executing another runtime call with the same
//!       index.
//!
//! [`on_initialize`]: frame_support::traits::Hooks::on_initialize

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.
