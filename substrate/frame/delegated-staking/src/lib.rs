//! # Delegated Staking Pallet
//!
//! This pallet implements [`sp_staking::DelegationInterface`] that provides delegation
//! functionality to `delegators` and `agents`. It is designed to be used in conjunction with
//! [`StakingInterface`] and relies on [`Config::CoreStaking`] to provide primitive staking
//! functions.
//!
//! Currently, it does not expose any dispatchable calls but is written with a vision to expose them
//! in the future such that it can be utilised by any external account, off-chain entity or xcm
//! `MultiLocation` such as a parachain or a smart contract.
//!
//! ## Key Terminologies
//! - **Agent**: An account who accepts delegations from other accounts and act as an agent on their
//!   behalf for staking these delegated funds. Also, sometimes referred as `Delegatee`.
//! - **Delegator**: An account who delegates their funds to an `agent` and authorises them to use
//!   it for staking.
//! - **AgentLedger**: A data structure that holds important information about the `agent` such as
//!   total delegations they have received, any slashes posted to them, etc.
//! - **Delegation**: A data structure that stores the amount of funds delegated to an `agent` by a
//!   `delegator`.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! Direct nomination on the Staking pallet does not scale well. Nominations pools were created to
//! address this by pooling delegator funds into one account and then staking it. This though had
//! a very critical limitation that the funds were moved from delegator account to pool account
//! and hence the delegator lost control over their funds for using it for other purposes such as
//! governance. This pallet aims to solve this by extending the staking pallet to support a new
//! primitive function: delegation of funds to an `agent` with the intent of staking. The agent can
//! then stake the delegated funds to [`Config::CoreStaking`] on behalf of the delegators.
//!
//! ### Withdrawal Management
//! Agent unbonding does not regulate ordering of consequent withdrawal for delegators. This is upto
//! the consumer of this pallet to implement in what order unbondable funds from
//! [`Config::CoreStaking`] can be withdrawn by the delegators.
//!
//! ### Reward and Slashing
//! This pallet does not enforce any specific strategy for how rewards or slashes are applied. It
//! is upto the `agent` account to decide how to apply the rewards and slashes.
//!
//! This importantly allows clients of this pallet to build their own strategies for reward/slashes.
//! For example, an `agent` account can choose to first slash the reward pot before slashing the
//! delegators. Or part of the reward can go to an insurance fund that can be used to cover any
//! potential future slashes. The goal is to eventually allow foreign MultiLocations
//! (smart contracts or pallets on another chain) to build their own pooled staking solutions
//! similar to `NominationPools`.

//! ## Core functions
//!
//! - Allow an account to receive delegations. See [`Pallet::register_agent`].
//! - Delegate funds to an `agent` account. See [`Pallet::delegate_to_agent`].
//! - Release delegated funds from an `agent` account to the `delegator`. See
//!   [`Pallet::release_delegation`].
//! - Migrate a `Nominator` account to an `agent` account. See [`Pallet::migrate_to_agent`].
//!   Explained in more detail in the `Migration` section.
//! - Migrate unclaimed delegated funds from `agent` to delegator. When a nominator migrates to an
//!   agent, the funds are held in a proxy account. This function allows the delegator to claim
//!   their share of the funds from the proxy account. See [`Pallet::migrate_delegation`].
//!
//! ## Lazy Slashing
//! One of the reasons why direct nominators on staking pallet cannot scale well is because all
//! nominators are slashed at the same time. This is expensive and needs to be bounded operation.
//!
//! This pallet implements a lazy slashing mechanism. Any slashes to the `agent` are posted in its
//! `AgentLedger` as a pending slash. Since the actual amount is held in the multiple
//! `delegator` accounts, this pallet has no way to know how to apply slash. It is the `agent`'s
//! responsibility to apply slashes for each delegator, one at a time. Staking pallet ensures the
//! pending slash never exceeds staked amount and would freeze further withdraws until all pending
//! slashes are cleared.
//!
//! The user of this pallet can apply slash using
//! [DelegationInterface::delegator_slash](sp_staking::DelegationInterface::delegator_slash).
//!
//! ## Migration from Nominator to Agent
//! More details [here](https://hackmd.io/@ak0n/454-np-governance).
//!
//! ## Nomination Pool vs Delegation Staking
//! This pallet is not a replacement for Nomination Pool but adds a new primitive in addition to
//! staking pallet that can be used by Nomination Pool to support delegation based staking. It can
//! be thought of as an extension to the Staking Pallet in relation to Nomination Pools.
//! Technically, these changes could be made in one of those pallets as well but that would have
//! meant significant refactoring and high chances of introducing a regression. With this approach,
//! we can keep the existing pallets with minimal changes and introduce a new pallet that can be
//! optionally used by Nomination Pool. The vision is to build this in a configurable way such that
//! runtime can choose whether to use this pallet or not.
//!
//! With that said, following is the main difference between
//! #### Nomination Pool without delegation support
//!  1) transfer fund from delegator to pool account, and
//!  2) stake from pool account as a direct nominator.
//!
//! #### Nomination Pool with delegation support
//!  1) delegate fund from delegator to pool account, and
//!  2) stake from pool account as an `Agent` account on the staking pallet.
//!
//! The difference being, in the second approach, the delegated funds will be locked in-place in
//! user's account enabling them to participate in use cases that allows use of `held` funds such
//! as participation in governance voting.
//!
//! Nomination pool still does all the heavy lifting around pool administration, reward
//! distribution, lazy slashing and as such, is not meant to be replaced with this pallet.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//! - Rewards can not be auto-compounded.
//! - Slashes are lazy and hence there could be a period of time when an account can use funds for
//!   operations such as voting in governance even though they should be slashed.
