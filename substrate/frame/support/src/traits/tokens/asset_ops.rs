//! Abstract asset operations traits.
//!
//! The following operations are defined:
//! * [`InspectMetadata`]
//! * [`UpdateMetadata`]
//! * [`Create`]
//! * [`Transfer`]
//! * [`Destroy`]
//!
//! Also, all the operations above (except the `Create` operation) use
//! the [`AssetDefinition`] to retrieve the `Id` type of the asset.
//!
//! Each asset operation can be implemented for different asset kinds
//! such as [`Class`](common_asset_kinds::Class) and [`Instance`](common_asset_kinds::Instance).
//!
//! Also, an asset operation can be implemented multiple times
//! using different strategies associated with this operation.
//!
//! A strategy defines the operation behavior,
//! may supply additional parameters,
//! and may define a return value type of the operation.
